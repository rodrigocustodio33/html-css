            <h2>Brooke Bazan</h2>
            Brooke Bazan got her start in gymnastics at the age of three at a "My Gym." When she turned four, Brooke began taking recreational classes at GMS Gymnastics. A few months after taking recreational classes, Brooke was invited to join the "shooting stars" program and pre-team at age five. After participating in several mini-meets, Brooke competed for the first time as an Xcel Bronze at the age of six. Brooke competed two meets of Xcel Bronze where she earned an all around score of above 38.0 at both meets. 

            Brooked competed one meet of level 3 in 2019 before moving to Capital Gymnastics. During the spring 2019 season, Brooke competed level 4 and went on to finish third on vault and beam at the Virginia State Championships. As a level 5 during the 2019-2020 season, Brooke began her season at Christmas on the Chesapeake where she won the beam title and came in second on the all around. At her next two meets, Brooke finished second and first in the all around, respectively. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Brooke's season was cut short as the remainder of the season was cancelled. 

            In 2021 Brooke was able to compete at the Virginia State Championships where she earned a gold medal on floor & silver medals on vault, bars, beam and all around. Brooke also has a spot on 2021's America's Top 100 for floor and all around. 

            Brooke kicked off her 2022 season as a level 8 at the Christmas on the Chesapeake where she earned silver medals on bars and floor. She then competed at Hill's Maryland Classic winning vault, silver in the all around and bronze on bars.

            Currently, Brooke trains 23 hours per week under coaches Morgan and Tish at Capital Gymnastics. Brooke's goal for her 2021 season is to improve on vault and begin flipping her vault. In the future, Brooke hopes to earn a college scholarship for gymnastics and compete in a U.S. Classic.
